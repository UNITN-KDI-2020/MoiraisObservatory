      "description":"The course will consist of four, live, one-hour webinars and aims to provide teachers with more confidence in integrating writing instruction into online and blended learning environments.\nWriting is a powerful tool for self-reflection and purposeful communication, often associated with solitude. Developing this skill, however, requires collaboration and constructive feedback. Through four hands-on workshops, we will investigate strategies to support English writing development in online learning environments for all proficiency levels and age groups.\nBeyond receiving new ideas, teachers will gain the experience of brainstorming, problem solving, and evaluating instructional methods with peer educators, leaving the sessions with greater confidence in your own resourcefulness and membership in a community of practice.\nDates: December 1 - 4, 2020\nTime: 17:00 - 18:00 GMT+1\nShort bio of the EL Specialist:\nThaddeus McCleary is an Instructor at Fort Hays State University (Kansas, USA), where he teaches composition and English language proficiency courses through partnerships with universities in China. He was an English Language Fellow in Ukraine from 2015 - 2017 and previously taught at public institutions in the USA and South Korea. Along with a Master of Education degree in TESOL, he recently completed an Educational Specialist degree program from the University of Missouri during which he designed and developed software for education.\nCertificate\nTeachers who participate in all four one-hour webinars will have access to a self-sign e-certificate, to which they can add their names and self-certify their participation.\nHow to Register\nPlease use the following link to register for the course:\nhttps://statedept.zoomgov.com/.../vJIscOGvrTwjGjz4I5ZnK...\nAfter registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.\nIf you have further questions, contact belgraderelo@state.gov or visit\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RELOBelgrade/",

Please read on for event description, materials list and booking info. If you need help with anything please email us at londondrawinggroup@gmail.com\nWhere: ONLINE!\nBook here:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.co.uk/.../henri-matisse-online...\nTime: London, UK\nIf you cannot make the live event we send a recording out to everyone that books shortly after the live session so you can watch it once within 3 days, any time of day:)\nThis class is suitable for ALL LEVELS!\n(We've had children as young as 4 join in, someone who is 97 and all ages in-between!)\nYou can use this site to convert UK time to where you are: https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html\nEVENT DESCRIPTION:\n\"What I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter - a soothing, calming influence on the mind, rather like a good armchair which provides relaxation from physical fatigue.\" - Henri Matisse\nThis is an online art class where tutor Frances Stanfield will guide you through Matisse's playful approach to art making.\nMatisse is best known for both his delightfully fluid drawing style and exquisite use of colour, particularly in his simplistic cut out works. You will be engaged in mimicking Matisse\u2019s expressive and restlessly experimental way of working to inspire you in your own creative endeavours.\nIn this class we will be making our cut outs from a series of images which Frances will be presenting to you and from still life.\nThis class is suitable for ALL LEVELS\nEveryone is welcome to join in on this Pay What You Can class\u2026 we know this is a difficult and uncertain time for many and we want to do our best to support you - As you are all probably aware, for the three of us at LDG creativity is our life-blood and our only source of income. Please be honest and pay what you can afford and our online classes will be able to run on a donations basis - if you are struggling, consider this one on the house! You just need to email us stating your situation at londondrawinggroup@gmail.com and we'll make it happen for you.\nYou will need:\n*Some Scissors!\n*Paper - you can use colour paper or you can paint/colour in paper prior to the class - Matisse painted his paper with Gouche if you want to really get your Matisse game on!\nYou can also use magazine pages, newspaper, wrapping paper, foil-anything you can cut easily!\n*A collection of organic matter such as leaves and flowers (fresh or dried)\n*Optional, but handy: pins and a piece of cardboard as big as your paper\nAND/OR Bluetak, Masking Tape/Sticky Tape\nIF YOU HAVE BOUGHT A LIVE CLASS TICKET WE HAVE SET UP AN EMAIL WITH THE ZOOM LINK TO ARRIVE IN YOUR INBOX 1 DAY BEFORE AND AGAIN ON THE DAY OF THE CLASS.\nIF YOU HAVE BOUGHT A RECORDING ONLY TICKET WE WILL SEND YOU MORE INFO A DAY BEFORE THE LIVE CLASS AND THE RECORDING LINK AN HOUR AFTER THE LIVE CLASS FINISHES.\nYOU CAN WATCH THE RECORDING ONCE WITHIN 3 DAYS.\nIf you need help with anything please EMAIL us through eventbrite or directly at londondrawinggroup@gmail.com - facebook and instagram messages are easily lost.\nAnd that's it!

      "description":"WEBINAR\nCRISI CLIMATICA E ZOOTECNIA\ndott. Emiliano Merlin\nL'attivismo per la giustizia climatica \u00e8 compatibile col consumo dei derivati dello sfruttamento animale? Dal momento che il sistema del cosiddetto \"allevamento intensivo\" trova l'opposizione della maggior parte delle persone, \u00e8 realistica una transizione collettiva verso le \"piccole fattorie a gestione familiare\" e l'allevamento estensivo?\nNel bel mezzo di una crisi sanitaria globale e in un pianeta che il sistema capitalista ha ormai portato sull\u2019orlo del collasso ambientale, sentiamo l\u2019urgenza di iniziare ad interrogarci rispetto alla \u201cquestione animale\u201d. Per formarci rispetto all\u2019impatto che l\u2019allevamento di miliardi di animali non umani ha sull\u2019emissione (diretta ed indiretta) di gas serra ed in termini di consumo di acqua, suolo e risorse naturali invitiamo tutt* a seguire l\u2019intervento di Emiliano Merlin, dal titolo \u201cCrisi climatica e zootecnia\u201d.\nEmiliano Merlin \u00e8 dottore di ricerca in Astronomia e ricercatore all'Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica. Si occupa anche di cambiamento climatico e della sua connessione con la zootecnia, e ha tenuto seminari per Climate Save Movement, Essere Animali e altre associazioni, in eventi pubblici e nelle scuole secondarie.",

      "description":"\"Storia: verifiche inclusive e personalizzate per la scuola secondaria di I grado\", webinar gratuito con Davide Apolloni e Nicoletta Manfrin\nIscriviti qui\nhttps://bit.ly/2UTFjZB\nPreparare verifiche diversificate di storia adatte a stili di apprendimento diversi non \u00e8 un compito facile, in particolare se il nostro intento non si limita alla sola valutazione degli apprendimenti. In questo webinar affrontiamo quindi l'argomento della realizzazione e dell'adattamento delle verifiche di storia per tutti gli alunni, compresi DSA, BES o con legge 104.\nGeneralmente, nei manuali scolastici sono disponibili ottimi materiali per l'analisi dei documenti, per svolgere attivit\u00e0 in aula o a casa, a gruppi o a coppie, ma non sempre sono presenti indicazioni su come costruire una verifica in base alle esigenze di ciascun insegnante e alunno.\nPartendo dai materiali del libro Verifiche personalizzate - Storia, Scuola Secondaria di I Grado, spiegheremo quali sono i criteri per la creazione di verifiche diversificate e inclusive da proporre alle varie tipologie di alunni. Interverranno:\nNicoletta Manfrin, Laureata in Lettere con indirizzo storico-artistico. Si \u00e8 specializzata in Storia dell\u2019Arte Moderna e si \u00e8 occupata della creazione e della gestione di laboratori didattici di storia presso alcuni Musei del Veneto. Insegna Italiano, Storia e Geografia nella scuola secondaria di primo grado. Per le edizioni Erickson ha realizzato materiali e strumenti per insegnanti ed alunni all\u2019interno di manuali di storia, di geografia e di storia dell\u2019arte per la scuola secondaria di I grado.\nDavide Apolloni, laureato in Lettere, con indirizzo storico-artistico, presso l\u2019Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Padova. Ha una Specializzazione in Storia dell\u2019Arte e delle Arti Minori.
